v1.9.5 BETA2 (18 jan 2020):
* extended set of supported MIDI sync commands (slave mode): Start/Stop/Continue, MIDI Clock, Song Position Pointer;
* Project properties: "Sync" settings allow you to specify the types of synchronization commands that the project accepts;
* Preferences -> MIDI: "Sync source" - MIDI device for receiving synchronization commands;
* bug fixes;
v1.9.5 BETA1 (3 jan 2020):
* Android 6+: USB MIDI support;
* Android: arm64 and x86_64 support; Android 2.3 support has been dropped; now the minimum is 4.1;
* Android: now the SunVox remains in the background after you close the window; if you want to completely unload the app - use the EXIT menu item or the BACK button;
* iOS: Audio Unit Extension (AUv3 instrument) has been added - SunVox can now be used inside any AU host;
* iOS: Main menu -> Export/import: additional export/import functions provided by the system;
* full support of 65534 modules per project and 32 tracks per pattern;
* optimization of graphic and sound engines;
* Distortion: new type "overflow2" (symmetrical overflow);
* Loop: incoming notes (Note ON commands) restart the loop;
* Delay now also delays the incoming events (note, pitch, phase, velocity);
* MultiSynth: new option "Generate missed Note OFF cmds";
* Pattern Editor: new function "Cyclic shift";
* new pattern effects (column EE):
  * 15 - change the relative note and finetune of the module; XX - relative note (00 - ignore; 01 = -127; 80 = 0; FF = 127); YY - finetune (00 - ignore; 01 = one semitone lower; 80 = 0; FF = one semitone higher);
  * 31 - jump to line XXYY (address) right after the end of the current line;
  * 32 - set jump address mode: 0 - absolute address, relative to the start of the timeline (default); 1 - ( pattern beginning + address ); 2 - ( pattern beginning - address ); 3 - ( next line + address ); 4 - ( next line - address );
* new pattern effects that irreversibly change the contents:
  * 38 - delete an event on track XX with a probability of YY (00..FF(100%)); see simple_examples/pat effect 38 self destructive.sunvox
  * 39 - cyclic shift of track XX down by YY lines;
  * 3A - generate a new iteration of YY-line polyrhythm on track XX; see simple_examples/pat effect 3A polyrhythm.sunvox;
  * 3B - copy track XX to a pattern named YY;
* MutliCtl, Sound2Ctl, Pitch2Ctl, Velocity2Ctl: "OUT Controller" range has been increased to 255, so now it's also possible to address the MIDI controllers (CC0 = 128, CC1 = 129, ...) of the connected module(s);
* new module visualization settings: background options (outline/fill), level scale (linear/logarithmic(dB)/RMS), peak meter;
* Preferences -> Main: new option "Autosave" (disabled by default);
* Preferences -> MIDI: "Module preview channel" - MIDI channel that will be used to receive notes during module pre-listening (when selecting a file);
* Preferences -> Timeline: new option "Hexadecimal line numbers";
* Preferences -> Interface -> Shortcuts: delete buttons [x] have been added;
* improved text fields (long text scrolling has been added) + improved virtual text keyboard;
* simple copy/paste (ctrl+c/v) in all text fields;
* Wi-Fi export/import: additional file information fields: size and modification date/time;
* export to WAV: new mode "File per module (connected to selected)" - export modules connected (as sources) to the selected module;
* new keyboard shortcut: SHIFT + 7 - cyclic shift up (for the selected region in the pattern editor);
* new keyboard shortcut: SHIFT + 8 - cyclic shift down;
* new command-line option "-?" for help (show usage with all possible options);
* new command-line options: "-v <vol>" - set volume; "-t <line>" - jump to the specified position of the timeline; "-p" - play;
* new command-line options: "-of <format>" - set output format (wav16 (default) or wav32); "-o <filename>" - output to file;
* new instruments and effects from other users (see the instruments and effects folders);
* new examples (SunVox Compo 2019.03 winners): Trackerbound - its over now; make a wish; Logickin Lambda - Soar Beyond; manganoid - Dash of Wind;
* new examples: NightRadio - 5100, 5101, 5102, Sines of Night; Manwe - Aquar.io Ambient; Philip Bergwerf - Venaya;
* updated version of SunVox library for developers;
* bug fixes;
* something else in the final release...
