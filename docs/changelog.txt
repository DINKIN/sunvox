* new module Pitch2Ctl: converts the incoming notes to the controller values (in some another connected module);
* new project parameter - "Time grid" (number of lines per grid cell);
* add option "nowin" to the sunvox_config.ini if you want to launch SunVox without the window (pure console mode without UI);
* Main SunVox Menu: new function "Merge project" (load project over the current);
* Timeline: target pointer (like in the Module View) has been added; use it to choose where to place the new pattern(s);
* Timeline: now the file is used for the pattern copy-buffer; so you can paste even after the SunVox restart;
* Analog Generator: new options "Retain phase" (don't reset the phase) and "Random phase";
* Analog Generator: new options "Filter frequency = note frequency" and "Velocity-dependent filter resonance"; see the analog_gen4 and analog_gen5 examples;
* MultiSynth: new button "Set" (set exact values of the curve);
* Vibrato: new controller "Exponential amplitude";
* Kicker: sine waveform has been added;
* LFO: random (noise) waveform has been added;
* Loop: new controller "Mode" (normal/ping-pong loop playback); see the loop2 example;
* MetaModule: optimized interface + default user controller names;
* improved MIDI Import and Export: channel/program/bank/controller support; new timing algorithm;
* ability to switch between the text fields using the TAB/SHIFT+TAB keys;
* new oscilloscope mode (module visualizer) - XY (X = left channel; Y = right channel);
* now all notes are visible on the musical keyboard: expand it up to see the full range;
* Module View (Routing): new function "Find" (find a module by name);
* Pattern Editor: improved hints;
* Pattern Editor: click on some event (note or some other command) and the corresponding module will be highlighted;
* Pattern Properties: new buttons "Shrink /2" and "Expand *2" has been added;
