SunVox is a small, simple, fast and powerful program for music creation, based
on modular synths and tracker-like interface. 
  ( Detailed info about music trackers is here:

SunVox is based on parts of the PsyTexx, the PsyTexxSynth engine and the 
SunDog engine.

Examples of use:
* composing music on PDA;
* music for games;
* "chip tunes" (sunvox tunes can be very small; 
  for example - 30 kBytes (unpacked) or 2 kBytes (when packed to ZIP)).
